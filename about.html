        <h2>About the Founder</h2>
        <p>
            The founder of this platform was born to narcissistic parents. His childhood was shaped by a series of tragic and disturbing events, which included his parents' abuse of drugs and involvement in intimate acts with him in the room. His father would repeatedly abuse his mother, and in a particularly disturbing moment, my father asked me to join them for three some during their intimate moments. 
        </p>
        <p>
            These early experiences left deep emotional scars, but as he grew older, the founder began to recognize the impact of narcissistic abuse on his life. Driven by a desire to create change and help others who have been through similar experiences, he decided to build a platform that fosters a safe space for healing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mission of this platform is simple: to provide a voice to those who have suffered in silence, to offer resources for healing, and to create a community where survivors of narcissistic abuse can feel supported. We are dedicated to interviewing and featuring people who have experienced hardship, but who are now ready to speak out and warn others.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that by sharing our stories, we can help others avoid the same struggles and build a community of support and awareness. Together, we can break the cycle of abuse and create a world where people no longer have to suffer in silence.
        </p>
